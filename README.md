# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

Capture live network traffic using Wireshark and analyze protocols and traffic types. This project provides a `.pcapng` capture file and a summarized report of the network protocols observed.

---

## Tools Used:

- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) â€“ Free network protocol analyzer

---

## Steps Performed:

1. **Installed Wireshark** on the laptop.
2. **Started live capture** on the active network interface (Wi-Fi).
3. **Generated traffic** by:
   - Visiting `google.com`
   - Running `ping google.com` in the terminal
4. Captured packets for **1 minute**.
5. Applied protocol filters to analyze:
   - TCP
   - DNS
   - ICMPv6
6. **Saved capture** as: `network_packet_capture.pcapng`
7. Summarized findings below.

## Protocols Identified:

| Protocol | Description                     | Observations |
|----------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| **TCP** | Transmission Control Protocol      | Used for HTTP communication, observed 3-way handshake and data segments |
| **DNS**  | Domain Name System               | Standard queries for `google.com` |
| **ICMPv6** | Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6 | `ping` command generated ICMPv6 Echo Requests and Replies |
